# Get started with Python and Scikit-learn for regression models

If you find a code on github and you want to run it but you don't have python on your machine, do the following :

**1) Use Github Codespace :**

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to write, run, and debug code directly from your GitHub repository. It's fully integrated with GitHub, making it a powerful tool for collaboration, especially for open-source projects or teams. Codespaces provides a complete, customizable development environment that can be accessed from any browser or via Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

- Create a Github account
- Go to the repository you want to work on. You can either create a new repository or use an existing one.
- Create a Codespace : look for the Code button on your repository page. Click the Code button, and you will see an option to Open with Codespaces. Click New codespace.

This will launch a cloud development environment with all the files from your GitHub repository automatically loaded. Once the codespace is created, you’ll be taken to the browser-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that looks similar to VS Code.

Here’s an overview of the interface:

***File Explorer :*** On the left side, you'll see your files. You can navigate your project’s folder structure and open files by clicking them.

***Editor :*** In the center is the editor area where you can write and modify your code. You can open multiple files in tabs.

***Terminal :*** At the bottom, there’s an integrated terminal (similar to a command-line interface) where you can run commands (e.g., install dependencies, run your project, etc.).

***Extensions :*** GitHub Codespaces supports VS Code extensions, so you can install extensions for linting, debugging, formatting, etc.as shown below

**2) Python :**

Python is the most famous tool used in ML. Download Python3 on your machine (Mac, Windows, Linux). Also download Visual Studio Code (free code editor) where you can run python codes and jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are good because you can debug easily, see the outputs directly and step by step.

Install Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. Follow these instructions to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the basic installation . You are going to use Python in Visual Studio Code in this course, so you might want to brush up on how to [configure Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-install-vscode?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott) for Python development.

**3) Scikit-learn :**

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html) is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.
Scikit-learn makes it straightforward to build models and evaluate them for use. It is primarily focused on using numeric data and contains several ready-made datasets for use as learning tools. It also includes pre-built models for students to try. 
To import the Scikit-learn library in your code, use ***import sklearn***.
