# Get started with Python and Scikit-learn for regression models

If you find a code on github and you want to run it but you don't have python on your machine, do the following :

**1) Use Github Codespace :**

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to write, run, and debug code directly from your GitHub repository. It's fully integrated with GitHub, making it a powerful tool for collaboration, especially for open-source projects or teams. Codespaces provides a complete, customizable development environment that can be accessed from any browser or via Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

- Create a Github account
- Go to the repository you want to work on. You can either create a new repository or use an existing one.
- Create a Codespace : look for the Code button on your repository page. Click the Code button, and you will see an option to Open with Codespaces. Click New codespace.
