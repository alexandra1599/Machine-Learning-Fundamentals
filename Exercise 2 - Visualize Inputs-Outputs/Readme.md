# Exercise 2 : Visualize Input and Output :

In the previous exercise, we loaded some data and fit a model to it. Several aspects of this were simplified, particularly that the data was hard-coded into our python script, and we didn't spend any time really looking at the data itself.

Here, we load data from a file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models or to understand their limitations.

There are various libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common libraries is Pandas. We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. Pandas can open data saved as text files and store it in an organized table called a DataFrame.
